Redmine Slack
=============

This plugin allows to send notifications from your Redmine installation to Slack.

It's heavily inspired by [Redmine Messenger](https://github.com/AlphaNodes/redmine_messenger/) but supporting only Slack. This way, we can take advantage of a lot of rich features included on Slack.

To configure this plugin you need to get Slack Verification Token and Slack Token.

## Slack Verification Token

You get this on Basic Information tab for your app.

## Slack Token

You get this on "OAuth & Permissions" tab for your app.


There's a global config and a per-project config to override global values.
